# FoundryVTT PF2e Automatic Rune Progression

This module is made to replace the `Automatic Bonus Progression` variant rule, instead it will automatically give the `potency`, `striking` and `resilient` runes on character's equipment when appropriate.

Nothing else from the regular `Automatic Bonus Progression` will be used.

**NOTE: The module will automatically disable the system `Automatic Bonus Progression` variant rule to function properly.**
