# FoundryVTT PF2e Automatic Rune Progression

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/K3K6M2V13)

**IMPORTANT: Whenever you enable this module on your world, existing characters need one update for the changes to be made, removing 1 HP is enough.**

This module is made to replace the `Automatic Bonus Progression` variant rule, instead it will automatically give the `potency`, `striking` and `resilient` runes on character's equipment when appropriate.

Nothing else from the regular `Automatic Bonus Progression` will be used.

# Alchemical Bombs

Alchemical bombs will not receive the runes.

# Settings

The module will automatically disable the system `Automatic Bonus Progression` variant rule to function properly.
